### Spring Boot from Scratch

Goal of this repo is to create a spring boot project from scratch 
so I understand each dependency I add to a project and how to resolve 
issues.



This is project mimics what [Spring Initialzr](http://start.spring.io) 
would do if you were trying to build a Spring Data JPA REST project.
